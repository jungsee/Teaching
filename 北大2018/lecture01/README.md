### Python Basics

In this part, we cover [Python Essentials](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/python_essentials.html), 
[NumPy](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numpy.html), 
[Matplotlib](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/matplotlib.html), [SciPy](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/scipy.html), and a little bit of
[SymPy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/Tutorial).

Previewing the online notes before coming to the lecture will go a long way.

Lecture notes are in this folder. Answer to practices will be uploaded later.

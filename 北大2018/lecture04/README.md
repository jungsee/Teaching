On Feb. 2nd, we will introduce exchange rate models and exchange rate forecast. We will review the use of Pandas and Linear Regression
toolkits in this section.

It would be helpful to quickly read through Section 1, 2, 3.1, and 3.2 of Rossi(2013), which is in this folder. If anything is unclear,
don't worry! We will clarify in lecture.
